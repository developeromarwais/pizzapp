## `Welcome to the PIZZAPP`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## `Purpose`

This project was created to demonstrate my skills in building a mini web app using react for the sake of `Pizza Task`

## `plug-ins and librariess`

There's a quite a few of react plug-ins and libraries that went into the creation of this Pizza web app
